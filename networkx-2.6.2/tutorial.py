# ## Tutorial
#
# This guide can help you start working with NetworkX.
#
# ### Creating a graph
#
# Create an empty graph with no nodes and no edges.

import networkx as nx
G = nx.Graph()

# By definition, a `Graph` is a collection of nodes (vertices) along with
# identified pairs of nodes (called edges, links, etc).  In NetworkX, nodes can
# be any [hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable) object e.g., a text string, an image, an XML object,
# another Graph, a customized node object, etc.
#
# # Nodes
#
# The graph `G` can be grown in several ways.  NetworkX includes many graph
# generator functions and facilities to read and write graphs in many formats.
# To get started though weâ€™ll look at simple manipulations.  You can add one node
# at a time,

G.add_node(1)

# or add nodes from any [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) container, such as a list

G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])

# You can also add nodes along with node
# attributes if your container yields 2-tuples of the form
# `(node, node_attribute_dict)`:
#
# ```
# >>> G.add_nodes_from([
# ...     (4, {"color": "red"}),
# ...     (5, {"color": "green"}),
# ... ])
# ```
#
# Node attributes are discussed further below.
#
# Nodes from one graph can be incorporated into another:

H = nx.path_graph(10)
G.add_nodes_from(H)

# `G` now contains the nodes of `H` as nodes of `G`.
# In contrast, you could use the graph `H` as a node in `G`.

G.add_node(H)

# The graph `G` now contains `H` as a node.  This flexibility is very powerful as
# it allows graphs of graphs, graphs of files, graphs of functions and much more.
# It is worth thinking about how to structure your application so that the nodes
# are useful entities.  Of course you can always use a unique identifier in `G`
# and have a separate dictionary keyed by identifier to the node information if
# you prefer.
#
# # Edges
#
# `G` can also be grown by adding one edge at a time,

G.add_edge(1, 2)
e = (2, 3)
G.add_edge(*e)  # unpack edge tuple*

# by adding a list of edges,

G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])

# or by adding any ebunch of edges.  An *ebunch* is any iterable
# container of edge-tuples.  An edge-tuple can be a 2-tuple of nodes or a 3-tuple
# with 2 nodes followed by an edge attribute dictionary, e.g.,
# `(2, 3, {'weight': 3.1415})`.  Edge attributes are discussed further
# below.

G.add_edges_from(H.edges)

# There are no complaints when adding existing nodes or edges. For example,
# after removing all nodes and edges,

G.clear()

# we add new nodes/edges and NetworkX quietly ignores any that are
# already present.

G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
G.add_node(1)
G.add_edge(1, 2)
G.add_node("spam")        # adds node "spam"
G.add_nodes_from("spam")  # adds 4 nodes: 's', 'p', 'a', 'm'
G.add_edge(3, 'm')

# At this stage the graph `G` consists of 8 nodes and 3 edges, as can be seen by:

G.number_of_nodes()
G.number_of_edges()

DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edge(2, 1)   # adds the nodes in order 2, 1
DG.add_edge(1, 3)
DG.add_edge(2, 4)
DG.add_edge(1, 2)
assert list(DG.successors(2)) == [1, 4]
assert list(DG.edges) == [(2, 1), (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]

# # Examining elements of a graph
#
# We can examine the nodes and edges. Four basic graph properties facilitate
# reporting: `G.nodes`, `G.edges`, `G.adj` and `G.degree`.  These
# are set-like views of the nodes, edges, neighbors (adjacencies), and degrees
# of nodes in a graph. They offer a continually updated read-only view into
# the graph structure. They are also dict-like in that you can look up node
# and edge data attributes via the views and iterate with data attributes
# using methods `.items()`, `.data('span')`.
# If you want a specific container type instead of a view, you can specify one.
# Here we use lists, though sets, dicts, tuples and other containers may be
# better in other contexts.

list(G.nodes)
list(G.edges)
list(G.adj[1])  # or list(G.neighbors(1))
G.degree[1]  # the number of edges incident to 1

# One can specify to report the edges and degree from a subset of all nodes
# using an nbunch. An *nbunch* is any of: `None` (meaning all nodes),
# a node, or an iterable container of nodes that is not itself a node in the
# graph.

G.edges([2, 'm'])
G.degree([2, 3])

# # Removing elements from a graph
#
# One can remove nodes and edges from the graph in a similar fashion to adding.
# Use methods
# `Graph.remove_node()`,
# `Graph.remove_nodes_from()`,
# `Graph.remove_edge()`
# and
# `Graph.remove_edges_from()`, e.g.

G.remove_node(2)
G.remove_nodes_from("spam")
list(G.nodes)
G.remove_edge(1, 3)

# # Using the graph constructors
#
# Graph objects do not have to be built up incrementally - data specifying
# graph structure can be passed directly to the constructors of the various
# graph classes.
# When creating a graph structure by instantiating one of the graph
# classes you can specify data in several formats.

G.add_edge(1, 2)
H = nx.DiGraph(G)   # create a DiGraph using the connections from G
list(H.edges())
edgelist = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
H = nx.Graph(edgelist)

# # What to use as nodes and edges
#
# You might notice that nodes and edges are not specified as NetworkX
# objects.  This leaves you free to use meaningful items as nodes and
# edges. The most common choices are numbers or strings, but a node can
# be any hashable object (except `None`), and an edge can be associated
# with any object `x` using `G.add_edge(n1, n2, object=x)`.
#
# As an example, `n1` and `n2` could be protein objects from the RCSB Protein
# Data Bank, and `x` could refer to an XML record of publications detailing
# experimental observations of their interaction.
#
# We have found this power quite useful, but its abuse
# can lead to surprising behavior unless one is familiar with Python.
# If in doubt, consider using `convert_node_labels_to_integers()` to obtain
# a more traditional graph with integer labels.
#
# # Accessing edges and neighbors
#
# In addition to the views `Graph.edges`, and `Graph.adj`,
# access to edges and neighbors is possible using subscript notation.

G = nx.Graph([(1, 2, {"color": "yellow"})])
G[1]  # same as G.adj[1]
G[1][2]
G.edges[1, 2]

# You can get/set the attributes of an edge using subscript notation
# if the edge already exists.

G.add_edge(1, 3)
G[1][3]['color'] = "blue"
G.edges[1, 2]['color'] = "red"
G.edges[1, 2]

# Fast examination of all (node, adjacency) pairs is achieved using
# `G.adjacency()`, or `G.adj.items()`.
# Note that for undirected graphs, adjacency iteration sees each edge twice.

FG = nx.Graph()
FG.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.125), (1, 3, 0.75), (2, 4, 1.2), (3, 4, 0.375)])
for n, nbrs in FG.adj.items():
   for nbr, eattr in nbrs.items():
       wt = eattr['weight']
       if wt < 0.5: print(f"({n}, {nbr}, {wt:.3})")

# Convenient access to all edges is achieved with the edges property.

for (u, v, wt) in FG.edges.data('weight'):
    if wt < 0.5:
        print(f"({u}, {v}, {wt:.3})")

# # Adding attributes to graphs, nodes, and edges
#
# Attributes such as weights, labels, colors, or whatever Python object you like,
# can be attached to graphs, nodes, or edges.
#
# Each graph, node, and edge can hold key/value attribute pairs in an associated
# attribute dictionary (the keys must be hashable).  By default these are empty,
# but attributes can be added or changed using `add_edge`, `add_node` or direct
# manipulation of the attribute dictionaries named `G.graph`, `G.nodes`, and
# `G.edges` for a graph `G`.
#
# ## Graph attributes
#
# Assign graph attributes when creating a new graph

G = nx.Graph(day="Friday")
G.graph

# Or you can modify attributes later

G.graph['day'] = "Monday"
G.graph

# # Node attributes
#
# Add node attributes using `add_node()`, `add_nodes_from()`, or `G.nodes`

G.add_node(1, time='5pm')
G.add_nodes_from([3], time='2pm')
G.nodes[1]
G.nodes[1]['room'] = 714
G.nodes.data()

# Note that adding a node to `G.nodes` does not add it to the graph, use
# `G.add_node()` to add new nodes. Similarly for edges.
#
# # Edge Attributes
#
# Add/change edge attributes using `add_edge()`, `add_edges_from()`,
# or subscript notation.

G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.7 )
G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (4, 5)], color='red')
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {'color': 'blue'}), (2, 3, {'weight': 8})])
G[1][2]['weight'] = 4.7
G.edges[3, 4]['weight'] = 4.2

# The special attribute `weight` should be numeric as it is used by
# algorithms requiring weighted edges.
#
#  Directed graphs
#
# The `DiGraph` class provides additional methods and properties specific
# to directed edges, e.g.,
# `DiGraph.out_edges`, `DiGraph.in_degree`,
# `DiGraph.predecessors()`, `DiGraph.successors()` etc.
# To allow algorithms to work with both classes easily, the directed versions of
# `neighbors()` is equivalent to `successors()` while `degree` reports
# the sum of `in_degree` and `out_degree` even though that may feel
# inconsistent at times.

DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.5), (3, 1, 0.75)])
DG.out_degree(1, weight='weight')
DG.degree(1, weight='weight')
list(DG.successors(1))
list(DG.neighbors(1))

# Some algorithms work only for directed graphs and others are not well
# defined for directed graphs.  Indeed the tendency to lump directed
# and undirected graphs together is dangerous.  If you want to treat
# a directed graph as undirected for some measurement you should probably
# convert it using `Graph.to_undirected()` or with

H = nx.Graph(G)  # create an undirected graph H from a directed graph G

# # Multigraphs
#
# NetworkX provides classes for graphs which allow multiple edges
# between any pair of nodes.  The `MultiGraph` and
# `MultiDiGraph`
# classes allow you to add the same edge twice, possibly with different
# edge data.  This can be powerful for some applications, but many
# algorithms are not well defined on such graphs.
# Where results are well defined,
# e.g., `MultiGraph.degree()` we provide the function.  Otherwise you
# should convert to a standard graph in a way that makes the measurement
# well defined.

MG = nx.MultiGraph()
MG.add_weighted_edges_from([(1, 2, 0.5), (1, 2, 0.75), (2, 3, 0.5)])
dict(MG.degree(weight='weight'))
GG = nx.Graph()
for n, nbrs in MG.adjacency():
   for nbr, edict in nbrs.items():
       minvalue = min([d['weight'] for d in edict.values()])
       GG.add_edge(n, nbr, weight = minvalue)

nx.shortest_path(GG, 1, 3)

# # Graph generators and graph operations
#
# In addition to constructing graphs node-by-node or edge-by-edge, they
# can also be generated by
#
# 1. Applying classic graph operations, such as:
#
# 1. Using a call to one of the classic small graphs, e.g.,
#
# 1. Using a (constructive) generator for a classic graph, e.g.,
#
# like so:

K_5 = nx.complete_graph(5)
K_3_5 = nx.complete_bipartite_graph(3, 5)
barbell = nx.barbell_graph(10, 10)
lollipop = nx.lollipop_graph(10, 20)

# 1. Using a stochastic graph generator, e.g,
#
# like so:

er = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(100, 0.15)
ws = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(30, 3, 0.1)
ba = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(100, 5)
red = nx.random_lobster(100, 0.9, 0.9)

# 1. Reading a graph stored in a file using common graph formats,
#    such as edge lists, adjacency lists, GML, GraphML, pickle, LEDA and others.

nx.write_gml(red, "path.to.file")
mygraph = nx.read_gml("path.to.file")

# For details on graph formats see Reading and writing graphs
# and for graph generator functions see Graph generators
#
# # Analyzing graphs
#
# The structure of `G` can be analyzed using various graph-theoretic
# functions such as:

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
G.add_node("spam")       # adds node "spam"
list(nx.connected_components(G))
sorted(d for n, d in G.degree())
nx.clustering(G)

# Some functions with large output iterate over (node, value) 2-tuples.
# These are easily stored in a [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) structure if you desire.

sp = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path(G))

# # Drawing graphs
#
# NetworkX is not primarily a graph drawing package but basic drawing with
# Matplotlib as well as an interface to use the open source Graphviz software
# package are included.  These are part of the `networkx.drawing` module and will
# be imported if possible.
#
# First import Matplotlibâ€™s plot interface (pylab works too)
