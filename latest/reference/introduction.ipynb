    "The structure of NetworkX can be seen by the organization of its source code.\n",

    "Most of the NetworkX API is provided by functions which take a graph object\n",

    "The source code for each module is meant to be easy to read and reading\n",
    "this Python code is actually a good way to learn more about network algorithms,\n",
